tion. Central banks play a crucial role in ensuring economic and financial stability. They pursue a monetary policy aimed at achieving low and stable inflation. In the wake of the global financial crisis, central banks have expanded their toolkit to address risks to financial stability and to manage exchange rate volatility, e.g., in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks have used a mix of conventional and unconventional tools to ease monetary policy, support liquidity in key financial markets, and maintain credit flows. Central banks need clear policy frameworks to achieve their objectives. Operational processes tailored to each country's circumstances enhance the effectiveness of central bank policies.
